## Step 1: Download and Install the App

1.  **Find the App:** Search for "Exness Trader" or "Exness Trading" on the Apple App Store (for iOS) or Google Play Store (for Android).

3.  **Access Accounts:** Once logged in, you can see and switch between your Real and Demo trading accounts.

## Step 3: Navigate the App Interface

The app typically has a few main sections, usually accessed via tabs at the bottom or a side menu:

* **Home / Dashboard:** An overview of your account, popular instruments, market news, etc.
* **Markets / Trade:** Where you can view different trading instruments (Forex, Crypto, Stocks, etc.), see live prices, and access charts. This is where you'll primarily place trades.
* **Portfolio / Orders:** Shows your currently open trades, pending orders, and often a history of past trades.
* **Wallet / Account:** For managing your funds â€“ depositing, withdrawing, transferring between accounts, and viewing account details.

Familiarize yourself with these sections by tapping around.

## Step 4: Fund Your Account (Deposit via App)

You can easily deposit funds into your real trading account directly through the app.

1.  **Go to the "Wallet" or "Account" section.**
2.  **Tap "Deposit".**
3.  **Choose Your Trading Account:** Select which of your real accounts you want to add funds to.
4.  **Select Payment Method:** Choose from the available deposit methods for your region (bank card, e-wallet, etc.).
5.  **Enter Amount and Details:** Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the deposit amount and complete the transaction using your chosen method.

## Step 5: Find Trading Instruments

The "Markets" or "Trade" section is where you find assets to trade.

1.  **Browse Categories:** Instruments are usually grouped by category (Forex, Crypto, Metals, Indices, Stocks, etc.). Tap on a category to see the available instruments.
2.  **Search:** Use the search bar (often a magnifying glass icon) to find a specific instrument by typing its name or symbol (e.g., "EURUSD", "Bitcoin", "BTCUSD").
3.  **Favorites:** You can usually tap a star or icon next to an instrument to add it to a favorites list for quick access.

## Step 6: Understand Charts and Quotes in the App

When you tap on an instrument in the "Markets" list, you'll typically see more details, including a price chart.

* **Quotes:** You'll see the current Bid (sell) and Ask (buy) prices.
* **Chart:** View the price movement over different timeframes (e.g., 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day). You can usually pinch to zoom and swipe to scroll. You can also add indicators (like Moving Averages, RSI) to the chart via chart tools.

## Step 7: Place Your First Trade Using the App (on Demo!)

Before trading with real money, use your **Demo Account** on the app to practice placing trades.

1.  **Select the Instrument:** In the "Markets" section, tap on the instrument you want to trade (e.g., EUR/USD). This will usually take you to its detail/chart screen.
2.  **Initiate a Trade:** Look for prominent "Buy" and "Sell" buttons, or a "Trade" button. Tap the action you want to take (e.g., tap "Sell" if you expect the price to fall).
3.  **Configure the Order:** A new screen will pop up.
    * **Volume/Quantity:** This is how much you want to trade (in lots or units). Tap here to enter the amount. **Start with the smallest possible volume (e.g., 0.01 lots) on your demo account.**
    * **Stop Loss (SL):** **THIS IS CRUCIAL.** Tap the Stop Loss section. You can usually set your SL by entering a specific price or setting a distance in pips from the current price. **Always set a Stop Loss to limit potential losses.**
    * **Take Profit (TP):** Tap the Take Profit section. Set the price level where you want the trade to automatically close for profit.
    * **Order Type (Usually Market Order):** For beginners, "Market Order" (or similar) means executing the trade immediately at the best available current price.
4.  **Review and Confirm:** Double-check all the details (instrument, volume, SL, TP, Buy/Sell direction).
5.  **Execute:** Tap the final "Buy" or "Sell" button to place the trade.

## Step 8: Monitor Your Open Trades

Once placed, your trade will appear in the "Portfolio" or "Orders" section of the app.

* Here you can see your active trades, their opening price, current market price, and your running Profit/Loss (P/L).
* The P/L will update in real-time as the market moves.

## Step 9: Close Your Trade

You can manually close an open trade at any time.

1.  **Go to the "Portfolio" or "Orders" section.**
2.  **Find the trade you want to close.**
3.  **Tap on the trade:** This might expand its details or bring up action options.
4.  **Look for a "Close Order" or similar button/option.** On some apps, you might need to swipe the trade entry to reveal a "Close" button.
5.  **Confirm:** Tap to confirm closing the trade at the current market price. Your P/L for that trade is then finalized.

## Step 10: Withdraw Funds via the App

Withdrawing is as straightforward as depositing via the app.

1.  **Go to the "Wallet" or "Account" section.**
2.  **Tap "Withdraw".**
3.  **Choose Account and Method:** Select the trading account and the withdrawal method (often must be the same as your deposit method).
4.  **Enter Amount and Details:** Follow the prompts. Exness is known for fast withdrawal processing.

## Key Features of the Exness Trading App (Look for these!)

* **Live Charts with Indicators:** Tools for technical analysis on the go.
* **Financial News and Analysis:** Often integrated to help you stay informed.
* **Price Alerts:** Set notifications for when an instrument reaches a specific price.
* **Account Management:** Full control over your accounts and funds.

## Important Tips for Mobile Trading Beginners

* **USE YOUR DEMO ACCOUNT ON THE APP FIRST!** Get comfortable with the interface, placing trades, and setting SL/TP using virtual money before going live.
* **Be Careful with Finger Placement:** On a small screen, it's easy to tap the wrong button or enter the wrong number. Double-check all order details before confirming.
* **Ensure Stable Connectivity:** A poor internet connection can lead to delays in order execution or monitoring.
* **Start Simple:** Focus on one or two currency pairs initially and master the basic trade execution process.
* **Always Set Stop Loss and Take Profit:** These are even more important on mobile where you might not be constantly watching the market.
* **Mobile is Great for Monitoring/Executing, Desktop Can Be Better for Analysis:** While charts are available, detailed technical analysis might be easier on a larger screen. Use the app for quick actions, and desktop platforms for in-depth analysis if needed.
