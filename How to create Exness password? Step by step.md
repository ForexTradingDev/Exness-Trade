Exness requires passwords for security. The two main types you'll create are:

1.  **Personal Area Password:** This password protects your main Exness account (your Personal Area) where you manage your profile, funds, and trading accounts. You create this during the initial registration.
2.  **Trading Account Password:** Each individual trading account (MT4, MT5, or Exness Trade account) has its own password. You create this when you open a new trading account within your Personal Area.

Understanding the difference is important. Your Personal Area password gets you *into* your Exness hub, while your Trading Account password gets you *into* a specific trading platform connected to that account.

## Password Requirements

Exness has specific requirements for creating strong passwords to ensure your security:

* **Length:** Passwords must be between 8 and 15 characters long.
* **Character Types:** Passwords must contain at least three different types of characters from the following four categories:
    * Uppercase English letters (A, B, C, ...)
    * Lowercase English letters (a, b, c, ...)
    * Numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
    * Symbols (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, ...)

**Important:** Your Personal Area password and your Trading Account passwords must be *different* from each other.

## Step-by-Step: Creating Your Personal Area Password (During Registration)

This is the first password you'll create when you sign up for Exness.

1.  **Start Exness Registration:** Go to the Exness website or open the Exness Trader app and click "Open Account" or "Register".
2.  **Enter Basic Information:** Fill in your Country of Residence and Email Address.
3.  **Reach the Password Field:** You will see a field labeled "Your Password" or similar.
4.  **Enter Your Desired Password:** Type in the password you want to use for your Personal Area. As you type, Exness will usually show indicators (like checkmarks or strength bars) to let you know if your password meets the requirements (8-15 characters, at least 3 character types).
5.  **Ensure it Meets Requirements:** If the indicators show your password is weak or doesn't meet the criteria, add uppercase letters, numbers, or symbols until it satisfies the requirements.
6.  **Confirm and Continue:** Once you have entered a strong password that meets the requirements, proceed with the rest of the registration process (agreeing to terms, etc.).

This password will be used every time you log in to your Exness Personal Area.

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Trading Account Password

You create this password *after* you have a Personal Area, when you add a new trading account (Real or Demo).

1.  **Log In to Your Exness Personal Area:** Go to the Exness website or app and log in using your email and Personal Area password.
2.  **Go to "My Accounts":** Find the section where your trading accounts are listed.
3.  **Click "Open New Account":** Select the option to create an additional trading account.
4.  **Choose Account Type & Platform:** Select whether it's a Real or Demo account, and choose the platform (MT4, MT5, or Exness Trade). You might also set currency, leverage, and initial balance (for demo).
5.  **Reach the "Set Trading Password" Section:** There will be a field specifically for the trading password of this new account.
6.  **Enter Your Desired Trading Password:** Type in the password you want for *this specific trading account*. Again, indicators should help you ensure it meets the 8-15 characters and 3 character types requirement.
7.  **Ensure it Meets Requirements:** Modify the password until it satisfies all criteria.
8.  **Confirm Password (if requested):** You might be asked to re-type the password to confirm it.
9.  **Click "Create" or "Open Account":** The new trading account will be created with this password.

This password will be used when you log in to the MT4, MT5, or Exness Trade platform using this specific trading account number.

## Resetting Your Password

If you forget your Personal Area password or a Trading Account password, you can reset it:

1.  **Go to the Exness Login Page:** On the website or app.
2.  **Click "Forgot Password?":** Find the link for password recovery.
3.  **Follow the Instructions:** Enter your email address (for Personal Area) or account number (for Trading Account) and follow the steps provided by Exness (usually involving email verification).

## Tips for Creating Secure Passwords

* **Mix Characters:** Always use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
* **Avoid Personal Info:** Do not use your name, birth date, sequential numbers (1234), or common words.
* **Make it Unique:** Do not reuse passwords across different websites or brokers.
* **Use a Password Manager:** Consider using a reputable password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords securely.
* **Don't Share:** Never share your passwords with anyone. Exness staff will never ask for your password.

## Conclusion

Creating your Exness passwords is a simple but crucial step for account security. Pay close attention to the requirements (8-15 characters, 3 character types) for both your Personal Area password and your individual Trading Account passwords. Always choose strong, unique passwords and keep them confidential. Start with your demo account passwords to practice logging into the platforms safely.
