## Why Trade in INR with Exness (for Indian Traders)?

Choosing INR as your trading account's base currency can offer several benefits for traders in India:

## Step 2: Deposit Funds in INR

Now that you have an INR trading account, you can deposit funds into it using INR payment methods available through Exness for India.

1.  **Log In to Your Exness Personal Area.**
2.  **Go to the "Deposit" Section.**
3.  **Select Your INR Trading Account:** Choose the specific trading account you just created with INR base currency.
4.  **Choose an INR Payment Method:** Select from the deposit methods available that support INR. Exness typically offers popular local Indian methods like:
    * **Local Bank Transfers** (often via gateways like UPI, NetBanking)
    * **UPI (Unified Payments Interface)**
    * **Net Banking**
    * **Bank Cards (Visa/Mastercard) in INR**
    * **E-wallets that support INR (like Skrill, Neteller if available in INR)**
    * **Cryptocurrencies like USDT (Tether) - though this is crypto, you can deposit USDT into your INR account, and Exness will convert it to INR.**
5.  **Enter Amount in INR:** Specify the amount in INR you wish to deposit.
6.  **Follow Instructions:** Complete the transaction as guided by the chosen payment provider. Exness is known for processing INR deposits quickly, often instantly for local methods.

## Step 3: Understand Trading with an INR Account

When trading on an INR account:

* Your **Balance**, **Equity**, **Margin**, **Free Margin**, and **Profit/Loss** will all be displayed in **INR**.
* When you trade a currency pair not involving INR (like EUR/USD), the platform calculates the profit or loss in USD (or the quote currency) and then automatically converts it to INR based on the current exchange rate for display in your account.
* Margin requirements for opening trades will also be shown in INR.

This automatic conversion by the platform means you can easily track your performance in your local currency without manual calculations.

## Step 4: Place and Manage Your Trades

The actual process of placing, monitoring, and closing trades is the same regardless of your account's base currency. You will use your chosen trading platform (MT4, MT5, or Exness Trade) and follow the standard procedures.

* Select your INR trading account within the platform.
* Find the instrument you want to trade (e.g., EUR/USD, Gold, BTCUSD).
* Open a new order, set your volume (lot size), Stop Loss (SL), and Take Profit (TP). Remember that the margin requirement and P/L displayed will be in INR.
* Place your Buy or Sell order.
* Monitor your open trades and close them when ready.

**(Refer to the specific guides for using MT4, MT5, or the Exness Trading App for detailed steps on placing trades on each platform).**

## Step 5: Withdraw Funds in INR

Withdrawing funds from your INR account is done through your Exness Personal Area, usually using the same convenient INR methods used for deposit.
