# How to Create an Exness MT4 Account: Trading Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for beginners on how to create a trading account within your Exness Personal Area that is specifically linked to the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform.

**Important:** This guide assumes you have already completed the initial registration and have an Exness Personal Area account. If you haven't, please refer to the guide "How to Create an Account with Exness?".

## Introduction: Creating an MT4 Account on Exness

Exness allows you to create multiple trading accounts within your single Personal Area. You can create accounts compatible with either MT4 or MT5. If you prefer to use the MetaTrader 4 platform, you need to create a specific MT4 trading account.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Exness MT4 Account

Follow these steps from within your Exness Personal Area:

1.  **Log In to Your Exness Personal Area:** Go to the official Exness website or open the Exness Trader app and log in using your registered email address and your Personal Area password.
2.  **Go to the "My Accounts" Section:** Once logged in, navigate to the section of your dashboard or sidebar that lists your trading accounts.
3.  **Click "Open New Account":** Look for a button or link that says "Open New Account", "+ New Account", or similar. Click on it to start the process of creating an additional trading account.
4.  **Choose Real or Demo:** You will typically be asked if you want to open a Real account or a Demo account.
    * **For beginners, it is highly recommended to start by creating an MT4 **Demo account** first.** This allows you to practice trading on MT4 with virtual money risk-free.
    * Select "Real Account" when you are ready to trade with real funds (only after extensive demo practice!).
5.  **Select the Platform: Choose MT4:** This is the crucial step for creating an MT4 account. You will see options for MT4 and MT5. **Click on the option for **MT4**.
6.  **Choose Your MT4 Account Type:** Exness offers several account types that are compatible with MT4. Common MT4 account types include:
    * Standard
    * Standard Cent (excellent for beginners with very small capital)
    * Pro
    * Zero
    * Raw Spread
    Read the brief descriptions of each type to understand the typical spreads, commissions, and minimum deposits (for Real accounts) or initial balances (for Demo accounts). Select the account type that best suits your intended trading style and capital.
7.  **Set Your Account Currency:** Choose the currency you want your trading account balance to be denominated in (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, etc.). Select this carefully as it's usually difficult or impossible to change later.
8.  **Set Your Leverage:** Choose the maximum leverage level for this account. Leverage can magnify both profits and losses. **For beginners, it is highly recommended to start with lower leverage (e.g., 1:100 or even lower) to manage risk effectively, especially on a real account.** On a demo account, you can experiment, but understanding lower leverage is still important.
9.  **Set Your Account Nickname (Optional but Recommended):** Give your account a descriptive name (e.g., "My MT4 Demo Practice", "MT4 Standard Real"). This helps you identify it easily if you have multiple accounts.
10. **Set Your Trading Password:** Create a specific trading password for *this new MT4 account*. This password will be used to log in to the MT4 platform. **This password must be different from your Personal Area password.** Ensure it meets Exness's password requirements (8-15 characters, at least 3 character types - uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
11. **Click "Create" or "Open Account":** Review your selections and click the button to finalize the account creation.

## Finding Your New MT4 Account Details

Once the account is created, you will see its details listed in your "My Accounts" section. Note down these details:

* **Account Number:** A unique number for this specific trading account.
* **Server:** The specific Exness server name you need to connect to in the MT4 platform (e.g., Exness-Trial for demo, Exness-Real...).
* **Trading Password:** The password you just set for this account.

Keep these details secure.

## What to Do Next

Now that you have your Exness MT4 account details:

1.  **Download MT4:** If you haven't already, download and install the Exness MetaTrader 4 platform (desktop, web, or mobile) from your Exness Personal Area or website.
2.  **Log In to MT4:** Open the MT4 platform and use your new MT4 **Account Number**, **Trading Password**, and **Server** to log in.
3.  **Start Practicing (on Demo!):** If you created a demo account, immediately start practicing trading using the guide "How to Use Exness on MT4?". Focus on platform navigation, placing trades, and risk management.
