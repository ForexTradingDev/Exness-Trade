3.  **Fill in Your Details:** Provide your country of residence, email address, and create a password.

## Step 2: Verify Your Account (KYC)

To fully activate your account and unlock all features (like higher deposits/withdrawals), you'll need to verify your identity and address. This is a standard regulatory requirement (Know Your Customer - KYC).

1.  **Log in to Your Personal Area:** Access your Exness account dashboard.
2.  **Complete Your Profile:** Fill in any remaining personal information requested.
3.  **Upload Identity Document:** Provide a clear scan or photo of a government-issued ID (passport, national ID card, driver's license).

5.  **Wait for Approval:** Exness will review your documents. This process can take some time, but they often process quickly.

## Step 3: Deposit Funds

Once your account is verified (or even before, with some limitations), you'll need to add money to your Real Account to trade.

1.  **Log in to Your Personal Area:** Go to your Exness dashboard.
2.  **Go to "Deposit":** Find the deposit section.
3.  **Choose a Payment Method:** Exness offers various local and international payment options (bank cards, e-wallets, bank transfers, etc.). Choose the one most convenient for you in India.
4.  **Enter Amount:** Input the amount you wish to deposit. Be mindful of the minimum deposit for your chosen account type.
5.  **Follow Instructions:** Complete the transaction according to the chosen method's requirements. Funds usually appear in your trading account quickly, often instantly.

## Step 4: Choose and Access a Trading Platform

Exness offers multiple platforms. For beginners, MT4 and MT5 are industry standards, while Exness Terminal is a user-friendly web-based option.

1.  **Log in to Your Personal Area:** Access your Exness dashboard.
2.  **Go to "My Accounts":** Find the list of your trading accounts.
3.  **Find Account Details:** For the account you want to use, note the account number, server, and password.
4.  **Download/Access Platform:**
    * **MT4/MT5:** Find the download links for desktop, web, or mobile versions in your Exness Personal Area. Download and install.
    * **Exness Terminal:** Access the web-based platform directly from your Personal Area via a "Trade" button.
5.  **Log In to the Platform:** Open the downloaded platform or the web terminal. Use your trading account number, password, and select the correct server provided in your Exness Personal Area.

## Step 5: Understand the Trading Platform Basics (Using MT4/MT5 as examples)

While platforms differ slightly, core functions are similar.

* **Market Watch:** A window listing available currency pairs and their current Bid (selling price) and Ask (buying price) prices.
* **Charts:** Graphical representation of the price movement of a currency pair over time. You can change timeframes (M1, H1, D1, etc.).
* **Navigator (MT4/MT5):** Where you find your accounts, indicators, Expert Advisors (EAs), and scripts.
* **Terminal (MT4/MT5):** A window usually at the bottom, showing your open trades, pending orders, account history, balance, equity, margin, etc.
* **New Order Window:** Where you execute trades, set volume, and add Stop Loss and Take Profit.

## Step 6: Learn Basic Forex Concepts

Before trading, understand these key terms:

* **Currency Pair:** Two currencies being traded (e.g., EUR/USD). The first is the Base Currency (EUR), the second is the Quote Currency (USD).
* **Pip (Point in Percentage):** The smallest price movement in a currency pair, usually the fourth decimal place (except for pairs with JPY, where it's the second). It's how you measure profit or loss.
* **Spread:** The difference between the Bid and Ask price. It's the broker's fee for executing your trade. You start a trade with a small immediate loss equal to the spread.
* **Leverage:** Allows you to control a large amount of money in the market with a small amount of your own capital (margin). For example, 1:100 leverage means you can control $100,000 with just $1,000 of your own money. **Leverage magnifies both profits and losses, making it very risky.** Exness offers high leverage, but beginners should use it with extreme caution or not at all initially.
* **Lot:** A standard unit of transaction volume in Forex.
    * Standard Lot = 100,000 units of the base currency.
    * Mini Lot = 10,000 units.
    * Micro Lot = 1,000 units.
    * Cent Lot (Standard Cent account) = 100 units. This is excellent for beginners to practice with minimal risk.

## Step 7: Place Your First Trade (on your Demo Account!)

It's time to practice buying or selling a currency pair.

1.  **Select a Currency Pair:** In the Market Watch window, find the pair you want to trade (e.g., EUR/USD).
2.  **Open a New Order Window:** Double-click the pair in Market Watch or right-click and select "New Order," or click the "New Order" button on the toolbar.
3.  **Configure the Trade:**
    * **Symbol:** Make sure the correct currency pair is selected.
    * **Volume:** This is your position size, measured in lots. **For beginners, especially on a Standard Cent account, start with the smallest possible volume (e.g., 0.01 Cent Lots). On a Standard account, start with 0.01 Micro Lots.**
    * **Stop Loss (SL):** **Crucially important!** This is a price level you set to automatically close your trade if the market moves against you by a certain amount, limiting your potential loss. Always set an SL.
    * **Take Profit (TP):** This is a price level you set to automatically close your trade if the market moves in your favor, securing your profit.
    * **Type:** Usually "Market Execution" for immediate buying or selling at the current price.
4.  **Choose Buy or Sell:**
    * Click **"Buy"** if you expect the price of the base currency to *rise* against the quote currency.
    * Click **"Sell"** if you expect the price of the base currency to *fall* against the quote currency.
5.  **Confirm:** The trade will be executed at the current market price.

## Step 8: Monitor Your Trade

Once placed, your trade will appear in the "Trade" tab of the Terminal window.

* You'll see the currency pair, volume, the price you entered at, the current market price, your Stop Loss and Take Profit levels, and your running Profit/Loss (P/L).
* The P/L will fluctuate with market movements. It will initially show a small loss due to the spread.

## Step 9: Close Your Trade

You can close your trade manually at any time before it hits your Stop Loss or Take Profit.

1.  **Go to the Terminal Window:** Find your open trade.
2.  **Right-Click the Trade:** Select "Close Order."
3.  **Confirm:** Click the confirmation button in the new window (e.g., "Close #... buy/sell ... at price"). Your trade will be closed at the current market price, and the final P/L will be added to your account balance.

## Step 10: Withdraw Your Funds

When you've made a profit (or want to withdraw your initial deposit), you can transfer funds from your trading account back to your bank or e-wallet.

1.  **Log in to Your Personal Area:** Go to your Exness dashboard.
2.  **Go to "Withdrawal":** Find the withdrawal section.
3.  **Choose a Payment Method:** Select the method you want to use. Usually, you must withdraw using the *same method* you used for depositing.
4.  **Enter Amount:** Input the amount you wish to withdraw.
5.  **Follow Instructions:** Complete any security checks (like entering a verification code). Exness is known for processing withdrawals very quickly, often instantly for many methods.

## Important Tips for Beginners

* **ALWAYS Start with a Demo Account:** This is the most critical step. Practice trading with virtual money until you are consistently profitable on demo and fully understand how the platform and market work. Do not rush to a real account.
* **Learn Risk Management:** This is non-negotiable. Never risk a large percentage of your account on a single trade (e.g., more than 1-2%). Use Stop Loss orders on every trade to protect your capital.
* **Start Small:** When you move to a real account, use a small deposit and the smallest possible trade sizes (Cent Lots are ideal for this). Get comfortable with real market emotion with minimal financial risk.
* **Educate Yourself Continuously:** Forex trading requires ongoing learning about market analysis (technical and fundamental), strategies, and global economics.
* **Understand Leverage:** High leverage can amplify profits but will also wipe out your account quickly with small price movements against you. Be extremely careful.
* **Manage Your Emotions:** Don't let fear or greed dictate your trading decisions. Stick to your trading plan.
* **Don't Risk Money You Can't Afford to Lose:** Forex trading is speculative.
