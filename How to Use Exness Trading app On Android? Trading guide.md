When you tap on an instrument, you'll usually go to its detail screen which includes quotes and a price chart.

* **Quotes:** You'll see the live Bid (sell) price and Ask (buy) price.
* **Chart:** A graph showing the price movement over time. You can select different timeframes (e.g., M1, H1, D1). On Android, you can usually pinch to zoom in/out and swipe left/right to view historical data. Tap chart icons to change chart types (candlestick, line) or add indicators.

## Step 7: Place Your First Trade Using the Android App (on Demo!)

Before you ever trade with real money, it is absolutely essential to **use your Demo Account** on the app to practice placing trades risk-free.

1.  **Switch to Demo Account:** Make sure you are currently logged into your Demo account within the app.
2.  **Select the Instrument:** In the "Markets" section, tap on the instrument you want to trade (e.g., EUR/USD). This usually takes you to its detail/chart screen.
3.  **Initiate a Trade:** Look for prominent "Buy" and "Sell" buttons on the screen. Tap the action you want to take (e.g., tap "Buy" if you expect the price to rise).
4.  **Configure the Order:** An order screen will appear on your Android device.
    * **Volume/Quantity:** This is the size of your trade. Use the number pad or +/- buttons on the screen to set the volume. **Start with the smallest possible volume (e.g., 0.01 lots) on your demo account.**
    * **Stop Loss (SL):** **THIS IS CRITICAL.** Tap the Stop Loss field. Enter the price level at which you want the trade to automatically close if the market moves against you. You can often drag a line on the chart or enter the price manually. **Always set a Stop Loss.**
    * **Take Profit (TP):** Tap the Take Profit field. Enter the price level where you want the trade to automatically close for profit if the market moves in your favor.
    * **Order Type:** For immediate trades, it's usually "Market Order" or similar.
5.  **Review and Confirm:** Double-check all the details (instrument, volume, SL, TP, Buy/Sell).
6.  **Execute:** Tap the final "Buy" or "Sell" button to place the trade.

## Step 8: Monitor Your Open Trades in the Android App

Once placed, your trade will appear in the "Portfolio" or "Orders" section of the app.

* Here you can see a list of your active trades.
* Tap on a trade to see more details like opening price, current price, SL/TP, and your running Profit/Loss (P/L).

2.  **Find the trade you want to close.**
3.  **Tap on the trade:** This might expand its details or bring up options.

## Important Tips for Mobile Trading Beginners on Android

* **USE YOUR DEMO ACCOUNT ON THE APP FIRST!** Get comfortable with the app's interface, placing trades, and setting SL/TP using virtual money.
* **Be Careful with Finger Placement:** On a touchscreen, it's easy to tap the wrong button or enter the wrong volume. Always double-check your order details before confirming.
* **Ensure Stable Connectivity:** Make sure you have a reliable internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) when trading to avoid execution delays.
* **Start Simple:** Focus on learning the basic trade execution and monitoring process for one or two instruments first.
* **Always Set Stop Loss and Take Profit:** Mobile trading means you might not be watching the market constantly. SL and TP are essential risk management tools.
* **Screen Size:** Be aware that detailed analysis might be harder on a small phone screen compared to a desktop platform. The app is great for monitoring and quick actions, but complex analysis might still be better suited for a computer.
