# How to Create an Exness Social Trading Account: Trading Guide

This guide explains how to get started with Exness Social Trading, a feature that allows users to copy the trades of successful traders or share their own strategies for others to copy. It covers the steps for both becoming an Investor (Copy Trader) and a Strategy Provider.

**Important:** Trading, including social and copy trading, involves a high level of risk and can lead to substantial losses. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Always understand the risks before participating.

## Introduction: What is Exness Social Trading?

Exness Social Trading is a platform and feature offered by Exness that connects traders. It allows users to engage in:

1.  **Investing (Copy Trading):** Users (Investors) can browse the performance of other traders (Strategy Providers) and automatically copy their trades into their own Exness account. This is suitable for those who want to participate in the market but prefer to rely on the expertise of others.
2.  **Providing Strategies:** Experienced traders (Strategy Providers) can share their trading strategy and track record. If other users copy their trades, Strategy Providers can earn a commission based on the profitability of the copied trades. This is suitable for successful traders looking for an additional income stream.

The Exness Social Trading experience is typically accessed through a dedicated **Exness Social Trading App**, separate from the main Exness Trader app, although it links to your primary Exness account.

## Accessing Exness Social Trading

The primary way to engage with Exness Social Trading is by downloading the **Exness Social Trading App** from the Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store (iOS). Once installed, you will log in using your existing Exness account credentials.

## Creating Your Social Trading Account/Profile

Within the Exness Social Trading App, you will set up your profile and choose your role (or potentially act as both Investor and Provider from different accounts). You'll use your main Exness account email and password to access the app.

The subsequent steps depend on whether you want to **Invest** or **Provide a Strategy**.

If you want to copy the trades of Strategy Providers, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Log In and Set Up Your Investor Profile

* Download and open the **Exness Social Trading App**.
* Log in using your registered Exness email and password.
* The app will guide you through setting up your investor profile. This might involve agreeing to specific terms for Social Trading.

### Step 2: Fund Your Social Trading Wallet

* Within the Social Trading app, you'll have a wallet or balance designated for Social Trading investments.
* You can transfer funds from your main Exness Personal Area or deposit new funds directly into this wallet via the app.
* Ensure you have funds available here to allocate for copying strategies.

### Step 3: Browse and Select Strategy Providers

* The app features a list or ranking of available Strategy Providers.
* You can view detailed statistics for each provider, including their profitability, risk score, drawdown, trading history, number of copiers, and the commission they charge.
* **Critically, analyze these statistics carefully.** Past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Look at consistency, risk score, and drawdown, not just high returns.
* Select a provider whose strategy, risk level, and performance history you are comfortable with.

### Step 4: Configure Copy Trading Settings

* Once you choose a Strategy Provider, you'll configure how you want to copy their trades.
* **Investment Amount:** Specify the amount of funds from your Social Trading wallet that you want to allocate to copying this specific provider.
* **Copy Ratio:** The platform usually determines a copy ratio based on your investment amount relative to the provider's equity.
* **Risk Management Settings:** **This is very important.** You can often set risk limits for the copying, such as:
    * **Stop-Loss Level:** A percentage of your invested amount that, if lost, will stop all copying from this provider.
    * **Maximum Leverage:** Limit the leverage used for copied trades in your account.
    * Configure these settings carefully to manage your risk.

### Step 5: Start Copying and Monitoring

* After configuring settings, confirm to start copying the provider's trades.
* Trades opened by the Strategy Provider will now be automatically replicated in your Exness account (specifically, in a trading account linked to your Social Trading investment).
* **Actively monitor** the performance of the provider you are copying and your own account equity within the app. Be prepared to stop copying if their performance is not as expected or if their risk level becomes too high for your comfort.

### Risks for Investors

* **Risk of Capital Loss:** You can lose the entire amount invested in copying strategies.
* **Past Performance is Not Guaranteed:** A provider's historical success does not mean they will be profitable in the future.
* **Drawdown:** Providers will experience losing periods, and your account will also experience drawdowns.
* **Platform & Execution Risk:** Although less common with major brokers, technical issues could potentially affect copying.
* **Lack of Control:** Once configured, trades are copied automatically, giving you less direct control over individual positions.

## Option 2: Creating an Account as a Strategy Provider

If you are a successful trader and want others to copy you, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Log In and Set Up Your Provider Profile

* Download and open the **Exness Social Trading App**.
* Log in using your registered Exness email and password.
* Navigate to the section for Strategy Providers (you might need to apply or switch roles).
* Set up your public profile, including your trading name, description, and potentially a profile picture. Be professional and transparent.

### Step 2: Create a Dedicated Strategy Account

* You cannot use just any existing trading account to be a Strategy Provider. You need to create a specific trading account *designated* for providing a strategy.
* Within the Social Trading platform/app interface, follow the steps to create a new Strategy Account. This account will be linked to your provider profile.
* You will choose the account type (e.g., Standard, Pro, etc., that are eligible for strategies), currency, and leverage for this specific account.

### Step 3: Define Your Strategy Parameters

* For your Strategy Account, you need to define the terms for investors who copy you.
* **Commission:** Set the percentage of the *profit* from copied trades that you will earn as commission. This is typically your primary income as a provider. Set a commission rate that is attractive to investors but reflects your profitability.
* **Risk Score:** Based on your trading style and volatility, the platform will calculate a Risk Score for your strategy. This score helps investors understand the potential risk level. Maintain a risk level consistent with what you want to attract.

### Step 4: Fund Your Strategy Account

* Strategy Accounts often require a minimum initial deposit to start and maintain. This shows commitment and ensures you have sufficient capital to trade.
* Deposit funds into your dedicated Strategy Account.

### Step 5: Start Trading on Your Strategy Account

* Now, log in to a compatible trading platform (like MT4 or MT5) using the credentials for your **dedicated Strategy Account**.
* Begin trading as you normally would. **Only trades placed on this specific Strategy Account will be visible for copying.**
* Be consistent with your trading style and risk management, as your performance on this account builds your public track record.

### Step 6: Monitor Your Performance and Copiers

* Use the Social Trading app or your Personal Area to monitor your strategy's performance statistics (growth, drawdown, risk score).
* Track the number of investors copying you and the total amount of funds being copied.
* Monitor the commission you are earning.

### Risks and Responsibilities for Strategy Providers

* **Performance Pressure:** You are trading with others' money linked to your results, which can be psychologically challenging.
* **Drawdown Affects Copiers:** Your losing periods directly impact your investors' capital, which can lead to them stopping copying.
* **Transparency is Key:** Be honest in your profile description and don't make unrealistic promises.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Understand that providing financial strategies or signals can have regulatory implications in some jurisdictions (though this is typically managed by the platform like Exness).

## Important Considerations for Exness Social Trading

* **Understand How it Works:** Whether investing or providing, take the time to fully understand the mechanics, fee structures (spreads, swaps, and performance commission), and risks.
* **Risk of Capital Loss:** **Repeat: Social trading is not a guaranteed way to make money.** You can lose significant capital.
* **Due Diligence:** Investors must carefully research Strategy Providers. Providers must understand the commitment required.
* **Fees:** Be aware of the costs involved, including the spread on trades and the performance commission paid to the Strategy Provider (for Investors) or earned (for Providers).

## Conclusion

Exness Social Trading offers an avenue for users to engage in the markets either by copying others' success or by sharing their own. Creating an account involves accessing the dedicated Social Trading app, setting up your profile, and choosing your path as an Investor or Strategy Provider. Each path has distinct steps, requirements, and most importantly, risks. **Always understand the significant risks of losing capital in social and copy trading before you begin.** Use the platform responsibly and never invest or risk more than you can afford to lose.
