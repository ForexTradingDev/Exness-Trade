This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for beginners on how to connect your Exness account to the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform and start trading. MT5 is a powerful platform, but this guide will focus on the essential functions for getting started. Trading involves significant risk; always start with a demo account.

## Introduction: What is MetaTrader 5 (MT5)?

* **Improved Functionality:** Generally considered more powerful and flexible than MT4.
* **Automated Trading:** Supports MQL5 programming language for developing and running trading robots (Expert Advisors) and indicators.
* **Reliability:** A stable and widely-used platform in the trading community.

## Step 2: Download and Install Exness MT5

It's recommended to download MT5 directly from your Exness Personal Area to ensure it's configured to easily connect to Exness servers.

1.  **Log in to your Exness Personal Area.**
2.  **Go to the "Trading Platforms" or "Downloads" section.**
3.  **Find "MetaTrader 5"** and select the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
4.  **Download the Installer.**
5.  **Run the Installer:** Follow the on-screen instructions to install MT5 on your computer or mobile device.

## Step 3: Log In to Your Exness Account on MT5

Once installed, you need to connect the MT5 platform to your specific Exness trading account.

1.  **Open MetaTrader 5.**
2.  **Go to "File" > "Open an Account".**
3.  **Find your Broker:** In the search bar, type "Exness". Select "Exness Technologies Ltd" or the relevant Exness entity. Click "Next".
4.  **Select "Connect with an existing trade account"** (or "Connect to an existing account").
5.  **Enter Your Login (Account Number):** Input the trading account number you noted in Step 1.
6.  **Enter Your Password:** Input the trading password for that account.
7.  **Select Your Server:** This is crucial! From the dropdown menu, select the specific server name associated with your account (e.g., Exness-Trial for demo, or a specific Exness-Real server number for real accounts). You can find this in your Exness Personal Area under the account details.
8.  **Click "Finish".** If your details are correct, you will be logged in, and you should hear a connection sound. Your account balance and details will appear in the "Terminal" window.

## Step 4: Navigate the MT5 Interface (Beginner Essentials)

MT5 might look complex initially, but here are the key windows you'll use:

* **Market Watch:** (Usually on the left, Ctrl+M to show/hide) Lists available trading instruments (symbols) with their current Bid (sell) and Ask (buy) prices.
* **Charts:** (The main central area) Displays price charts for selected instruments. Each chart shows the price movement over a specific timeframe.
* **Navigator:** (Usually on the left, Ctrl+N to show/hide) Contains your trading accounts, indicators, Expert Advisors (EAs), and scripts. You can drag indicators or EAs onto charts from here.
* **Terminal:** (Usually at the bottom, Ctrl+T to show/hide) This is one of the most important windows. It has several tabs:
    * **Trade:** Shows your open positions, pending orders, account balance, equity, margin, and floating profit/loss.
    * **History:** Shows your closed trades, deposits, and withdrawals.
    * Other tabs include News, Mailbox, Journal, etc.

## Step 5: Find Trading Instruments (Symbols)

Exness offers many instruments. Here's how to access them in MT5:

1.  **Go to the Market Watch window.**
2.  If you don't see the instrument you want, right-click anywhere in the Market Watch window.
3.  Select **"Symbols"**.
4.  A new window will open showing categories (Forex, Crypto, Metals, Indices, etc.). Navigate through these categories.
5.  Click on a symbol (e.g., EURUSD, BTCUSD) and click **"Show Symbol"** (or double-click it). This will add it to your main Market Watch list.
6.  Click "Close". The symbols you added are now in your Market Watch.

## Step 6: Understand Charts and Market Data

Charts are essential for technical analysis.

1.  **Open a Chart:** Drag a symbol from the Market Watch window onto a chart area, or right-click a symbol in Market Watch and select "Chart Window".
2.  **Timeframes:** Use the toolbar or the "Charts" menu to change the timeframe (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, W1, MN). This changes how much time each candlestick/bar represents.
3.  **Chart Types:** Switch between Candlestick, Bar, or Line charts using the toolbar.
4.  **Add Indicators:** Open the Navigator window, expand the "Indicators" list, and drag an indicator (e.g., Moving Average, RSI) onto your chart. You can configure its settings in the pop-up window.
5.  **Bid/Ask Lines:** On the chart, you'll see lines representing the current Bid and Ask prices. The Spread is the difference between these lines.

## Step 7: Place Your First Trade (on your Demo Account!)

Now, let's place a trade. **Always practice on your Demo Account first!**

1.  **Open the Order Window:**
    * Click the **"New Order"** button on the toolbar (usually near the top left), or
    * Right-click the instrument in Market Watch and select "New Order", or
    * Press F9 on your keyboard.
2.  **Configure the Order:**
    * **Symbol:** Make sure the correct instrument is selected.
    * **Type:** Usually "Market Execution" for immediate trading, or "Pending Order" (see below). For beginners, Market Execution is simplest.
    * **Volume:** This is your position size, measured in lots. **Start with the smallest possible volume (e.g., 0.01 lots) on your demo account.**
    * **Stop Loss (SL):** **CRUCIAL!** Enter the price level at which you want the trade to automatically close to limit your loss if the market moves against you. **Always set an SL.**
    * **Take Profit (TP):** Enter the price level at which you want the trade to automatically close to lock in profit if the market moves in your favor.
    * **Deviation (for Market Execution):** Allows slight price variations during execution. For beginners, the default is often fine.
3.  **Choose Buy or Sell:**
    * Click **"Buy by Market"** if you believe the price will rise.
    * Click **"Sell by Market"** if you believe the price will fall.
4.  **Confirm:** The trade will be executed.

**Pending Orders (Basic):** Instead of Market Execution, you can choose "Pending Order". This allows you to set an order to open automatically when the price reaches a specific level in the future. Types include Buy Limit, Sell Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Stop. You must set the entry price and an expiry time (optional).

## Step 8: Monitor Your Open Trades

Your active trades and pending orders appear in the **"Trade" tab of the Terminal window**.

* See details like Symbol, Volume, Entry Price, current market price, SL, TP, and your running Profit/Loss.
* The P/L will fluctuate based on market movements.

## Step 9: Modify or Close Your Trade

You can adjust your SL/TP or close a trade manually.

1.  **Modify:** In the "Trade" tab of the Terminal, right-click on the open position or pending order. Select **"Modify or Delete Order"**. You can then change the SL and TP levels.
2.  **Close Manually:**
    * In the "Trade" tab of the Terminal, double-click the open position. A new window will appear.
    * Click the yellow **"Close [Symbol] by Market"** button.
    * Alternatively, right-click the trade and select **"Close Order"**.

## Step 10: Withdraw Your Funds

Withdrawals are managed through your Exness Personal Area, not directly within the MT5 platform itself.

1.  **Log in to your Exness Personal Area** on the Exness website or through the Exness Trader mobile app.
2.  Go to the **"Withdrawal"** section.
3.  Choose your preferred withdrawal method (usually the same method used for deposit).
4.  Enter the amount and follow the instructions.

## Important Tips for Trading on MT5 with Exness (Beginners)

* **MASTER THE DEMO ACCOUNT:** Spend significant time practicing *all* these steps on your Exness Demo account within MT5 until you are fully comfortable and consistently profitable in a simulated environment.
* **Learn the Interface:** Take time to explore all the menus and toolbars in MT5. Watch tutorials online.
* **Understand Volume (Lot Size):** Incorrect volume is a major reason for quick losses. Always know the value of 1 pip for your chosen volume and currency pair.

* **Start Simple:** Don't clutter your charts with too many indicators initially. Focus on understanding price action and a few key tools.
