# How to Trade Forex on Exness For Beginners: Trading Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step introduction to trading Forex on the Exness platform, specifically designed for beginners. Forex trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for everyone. Always start with a demo account and understand the risks involved before trading with real money.

## Introduction to Forex and Exness

**Forex (Foreign Exchange)** is the global decentralized market where currencies are traded. It's the largest financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars exchanged daily. Trading Forex involves speculating on the price movements of currency pairs (like EUR/USD, GBP/JPY). You profit if your prediction about the price direction is correct.

## Step 5: Download and Install a Trading Platform

You need a trading platform to connect to the market.

3.  **Find Your Chosen Platform:** Locate the download links for MT4, MT5, or access the Exness Terminal web platform or download the Exness Trader mobile app.

5.  **Log In to the Platform:** Open the platform. Use the **Account Number**, **Trading Password**, and **Server** of your *specific trading account* (created in Step 3) to log in. Make sure you are using the correct server (Trial for demo, a specific Real server for real).

## Step 6: Understand the Trading Platform Basics (Using MT4/MT5 as examples)

While platforms differ, core elements are similar:

* **Market Watch:** See a list of tradable currency pairs and their current buy (Ask) and sell (Bid) prices.
* **Charts:** View price movements graphically over different timeframes (e.g., 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day).
* **Terminal/Toolbox:** See your account balance, open trades, pending orders, history, etc.
* **Navigator (MT4/MT5):** Access accounts, indicators, and EAs.

## Step 7: Learn Basic Forex Concepts

Before trading, understand key terms:

* **Currency Pair:** The two currencies being traded (e.g., EUR/USD).
* **Pip:** The smallest price movement unit.
* **Spread:** The difference between Bid and Ask price, the broker's cost.
* **Leverage:** Allows controlling a large position with a small amount of capital. **Increases risk significantly.**
* **Lot/Volume:** The size of your trade (Standard, Mini, Micro, Cent lots). Cent accounts are best for beginners to start very small.

## Step 8: Place Your First Forex Trade (on your Demo Account!)

It's time to practice executing a trade using your demo account.

1.  **Select a Currency Pair:** In Market Watch, choose a pair (e.g., EUR/USD).
2.  **Open New Order Window:** Click the "New Order" button on the platform.
3.  **Configure Trade:**
    * **Symbol:** Check the correct currency pair.
    * **Volume:** **Start with the smallest possible volume (e.g., 0.01 lots on a Standard/Razor/Pro account, or 0.01 Cent Lots on a Standard Cent account) on your demo.**
    * **Stop Loss (SL):** **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT!** Set a price to automatically close your trade and limit losses if the market moves against you. **Always use SL.**
    * **Take Profit (TP):** Set a price to automatically close your trade and secure profits.
    * **Type:** Usually "Market Execution" for an immediate trade.
4.  **Choose Buy or Sell:** Click "Buy" if you expect the first currency to strengthen, "Sell" if you expect it to weaken.
5.  **Execute:** Place the order.

## Step 9: Monitor and Close Your Trade

Your open trade will appear in the Terminal/Toolbox window.

* Monitor your floating Profit/Loss.
* The trade will close automatically if SL or TP is hit.
* You can manually close the trade at any time by right-clicking (desktop) or tapping/swiping (mobile) on the trade in the Terminal/Toolbox and selecting "Close Order".

## Step 10: Withdraw Your Funds (Real Account Only)

When you have profits (on a Real Account), you can withdraw.

1.  **Log in to Your Exness Personal Area.**
2.  **Go to "Withdrawal".**
3.  **Select Account and Method:** Choose the trading account and the withdrawal method (often must be the same as the deposit method).
4.  **Enter Amount:** Specify the amount.
5.  **Follow Instructions:** Complete security checks. Exness is known for fast withdrawals.

## Important Tips for Beginners

* **START AND MASTER THE DEMO ACCOUNT:** Spend weeks or months practicing *all* steps here on your Exness demo account before trading with real money. This is the single most important tip.
* **Prioritize Risk Management:** **Always use Stop Loss orders.** Never risk a large percentage of your account on one trade. Understand position sizing.
* **Start Small (Real Account):** When you move to a real account, use the smallest possible volume (Cent accounts are great for this) and minimal leverage to get used to real market emotions with minimal risk.
* **Educate Yourself:** Continuously learn about Forex, analysis, and trading psychology.
* **Understand Leverage:** Leverage is a double-edged sword. It magnifies profits but can lead to rapid, significant losses. Use it cautiously.
* **Be Patient and Disciplined:** Stick to your trading plan and manage your emotions.
