## The Account Creation Process

Creating an Exness account involves two main parts:

1.  **Registration:** Providing basic personal information to set up your initial account profile.
2.  **Verification (KYC):** Confirming your identity and address by uploading necessary documents. This is a standard security and regulatory requirement.

You can complete this process via the Exness website on your computer or through the Exness Trader mobile app on your smartphone.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Exness Account

Follow these steps to create your account:

**Part 1: Initial Registration**

1.  **Visit the Exness Website or Open the App:**
    * **Website:** Go to the official Exness website using your web browser.
    * **Mobile App:** Download and open the "Exness Trader" app from the Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store (iOS).
2.  **Click "Open Account" or "Register":** This button is usually prominent on the homepage or the app's initial screen.
3.  **Select Your Country of Residence:** Choose the country where you currently live from the dropdown list. Make sure this is accurate, as it affects verification requirements and available payment methods.
4.  **Enter Your Email Address:** Provide a valid email address that you actively use. This will be used for account communication and login.
5.  **Create a Strong Password:** Set a secure password for your account. It should be a combination of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols. Remember this password.
6.  **Optional: Enter a Partner Code (if applicable):** If you were referred by an Exness partner, you might have a code to enter here.
7.  **Read and Accept Terms:** Carefully read the Exness legal documents, including the Client Agreement and Privacy Policy. Tick the box to confirm you understand and agree.
8.  **Click "Register" or "Continue":** Submit your basic information.

Congratulations! You have completed the initial registration. You will now be directed to your Personal Area or dashboard.

**Part 2: Completing Profile and Verification (KYC)**

After registration, you need to complete your profile and verify your identity and address. This is essential for full account functionality (like unlimited deposits and withdrawals).

1.  **Access Your Personal Area:** If you're not already there, log in to your Exness account using your email and password.
2.  **Complete Your Profile Information:** The platform will prompt you to complete your profile. This typically includes providing:
    * Your full name (must match your ID).
    * Date of birth.
    * Residential address.
    * Phone number (you may need to verify this via SMS).
    * Employment status and financial information (e.g., source of funds, trading experience). This helps Exness understand your profile and assess suitability.
3.  **Verify Your Identity:** You will be asked to upload a copy of a valid government-issued identification document. Ensure the document is clear, not expired, and all details are visible. Accepted documents commonly include:
    * Passport
    * National ID Card
    * Driver's License
4.  **Verify Your Address:** You will also need to upload a document that proves your residential address. This document should be recent (usually within the last 3-6 months) and clearly show your name and address. Accepted documents commonly include:
    * Utility Bill (electricity, water, gas, internet, landline phone)
    * Bank Statement
    * Government-issued address certificate or tax document
5.  **Submit Documents:** Upload the scanned copies or photos of your chosen documents through the provided interface in your Personal Area.
6.  **Wait for Review:** Exness will review the information and documents you submitted. This verification process can take some time, from a few minutes to several business days, depending on the clarity of your documents and the volume of requests. You will be notified once your account is fully verified.

## Choosing Your Account Type

During the registration or shortly after accessing your Personal Area, you will have the option to create different types of trading accounts (e.g., Standard, Standard Cent, Pro, Zero, Raw Spread).

* For beginners, the **Standard Account** or **Standard Cent Account** (available on MT4) is often recommended due to lower minimum deposits and simpler trading conditions (spread-only).
* You can create multiple trading accounts of different types within your single Exness Personal Area.

## What Happens After Verification?

Once your Exness account is fully verified:

* Your deposit and withdrawal limits will be increased or removed.
* You can deposit real funds into your trading account using the available payment methods.
* You can download/access the trading platforms (MT4, MT5, Exness Trader, Exness Terminal) and log in using the credentials for the specific trading account you created (account number, trading password, server).
* You can start trading on a real account (though starting with demo is highly recommended!).

## Important Notes for Account Creation

* **Accuracy is Key:** Ensure all information you provide (name, date of birth, address) is accurate and exactly matches your verification documents. Discrepancies will cause delays or failure in verification.
* **Clear Documents:** Make sure the photos or scans of your ID and address proof are clear, well-lit, and that all four corners of the document are visible.
* **Document Validity:** Use documents that are valid and not expired.
* **One Personal Area:** You only need one Exness Personal Area linked to your email address. You can create multiple *trading accounts* within that single Personal Area.

## Start with Your Demo Account Immediately!

Even after creating and verifying your real account, **STOP!** Do not deposit real money yet. Your Exness account automatically comes with a free **Demo Account**. This account is funded with virtual money and allows you to practice trading under real market conditions without any risk. Spend significant time practicing on the demo account until you are fully comfortable with the platform and your trading strategy.

## Conclusion

Creating an account with Exness is a straightforward process involving initial registration and identity verification. Once verified, you gain full access to your Personal Area, can fund your account, and connect to trading platforms. Remember to prioritize practicing with your demo account to build necessary skills and confidence before trading with real capital.
