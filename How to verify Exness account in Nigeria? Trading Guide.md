Verifying your Exness account is crucial for several reasons:

* **Security:** It helps protect your account from unauthorized access and fraud.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Exness is required by its regulators to verify client identities to combat financial crime.
* **Unlocking Full Features:** Verification removes limitations on deposits, withdrawals, and trading volume, giving you full access to your account's capabilities.
* **Building Trust:** It's a fundamental part of establishing a secure trading relationship.

The verification process involves confirming your identity and your residential address using acceptable documents from Nigeria.

## The Verification Process Overview

The verification process takes place within your Exness Personal Area and typically involves three main steps after initial registration:

1.  **Complete Your Economic Profile:** Providing details about your trading experience and financial situation.
2.  **Provide Proof of Identity (POI):** Uploading a document to confirm who you are.
3.  **Provide Proof of Residence (POR):** Uploading a document to confirm where you live.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Verifying Your Exness Account in Nigeria

Follow these steps from within your Exness Personal Area:

### Step 1: Log In to Your Exness Personal Area

* Go to the official Exness website or open the Exness Trader mobile app.
* Log in using your registered email address and your Personal Area password.

### Step 2: Start the Verification Process

* Once logged in, you will likely see clear prompts or notifications asking you to complete your account verification. Look for banners, messages on your dashboard, or a specific "Verification" or "Complete Profile" section.
* Tap or click on the option to begin the verification process.

### Step 3: Complete Your Economic Profile

* Exness needs to understand your trading background. You will be asked questions about:
    * Your level of trading experience.
    * Your knowledge of financial markets.
    * Your employment status and industry.
    * Your source of funds.
    * Your estimated annual income and total savings.
* Provide accurate and truthful answers to these questions.

### Step 4: Verify Your Identity (Proof of Identity - POI)

You need to upload a clear, valid document issued by the Nigerian government that confirms your identity.

1.  **Select Document Type:** Choose the type of identification document you will provide from the list of accepted options for Nigeria.
2.  **Prepare Your Document:** Ensure your chosen document is valid (not expired) and in good condition.
    * **Commonly Accepted Nigerian Identity Documents include:**
        * **International Passport**
        * **National Identity Card (NIN Slip or the physical card)**
        * **Driver's License**
        * **Voter's Card (Permanent Voter's Card - PVC)**
3.  **Capture/Upload Document:**
    * **Mobile App:** You may be able to use your phone's camera directly through the app. Follow the instructions (e.g., take a photo of the front, and sometimes the back).
    * **Website:** You will need to upload scanned copies or clear photos of the document saved on your computer or phone.
4.  **Ensure Clarity:** The image must be well-lit, in focus, and all text must be readable. Make sure all four corners of the document are visible. The name and date of birth on the document must exactly match the information you provided in your Exness profile.
5.  **Submit:** Upload the required images of your chosen identity document.

### Step 5: Verify Your Residence (Proof of Residence - POR)

You need to upload a clear, recent document that confirms your residential address in Nigeria.

1.  **Select Document Type:** Choose the type of document you will provide from the list of accepted options for Nigeria.
2.  **Prepare Your Document:** Ensure the document clearly shows your name and residential address. **Crucially, it must be recent, usually issued within the last 3-6 months.**
    * **Commonly Accepted Nigerian Proof of Residence Documents include:**
        * **Bank Statement** (from a Nigerian bank, showing name and address)
        * **Utility Bill** (electricity, water, gas, internet, landline phone bill, showing name and address)
        * **Tenancy Agreement** (sometimes accepted, check Exness's specific requirements)
        * **Government-issued letters or certificates containing your address**
3.  **Capture/Upload Document:** Similar to identity verification, use the app's camera or upload saved files. Capture the entire document.
4.  **Ensure Clarity and Recency:** The image must be clear and readable, especially your name, address, and the issue date of the document. Ensure all four corners are visible. The name and address on the document must exactly match the information you provided in your Exness profile.
5.  **Submit:** Upload the required images of your chosen residence document.

### Step 6: Potential Additional Verification Steps

In some cases, Exness may require further verification, such as:

* Verifying your phone number via SMS code.
* A brief video verification call.
* Requesting alternative documents if the initially submitted ones were unclear or didn't meet the requirements.

Follow any additional instructions provided within your Personal Area or via email.

### Step 7: Wait for Review

Once you have submitted both your Proof of Identity and Proof of Residence documents, Exness's verification team will review them.

* You can check the status of your verification within your Personal Area.
* Review time can vary, but Exness often processes verifications relatively quickly if the documents are clear and meet the requirements. It could take from a few minutes to several business days.
* You will receive a notification (typically via email and within your Personal Area) once your account verification is successfully completed.

## What Happens After Successful Verification?

Once your Exness account is fully verified for Nigeria:

* Restrictions on deposits and withdrawals related to verification are typically removed.
* You gain full access to fund your account using the available payment methods for Nigeria and start trading on your Real accounts.
* Your account's security level is enhanced.

## Important Tips for Smooth Verification

* **Accurate Information:** Ensure the personal details (Name, Date of Birth, Address) in your Exness profile are exactly correct and match your documents.
* **High-Quality Images:** Use clear, well-lit photos or scans where all text is readable. Avoid blurry images or glare.
* **Valid and Recent Documents:** Ensure your ID is not expired and your Proof of Residence is recent (within the last 3-6 months).
* **Patiently Wait:** Allow time for the verification team to review your documents.
* **Check Status and Notifications:** Monitor your Exness Personal Area and email for any updates or requests for more information.
