MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is a highly popular electronic trading platform widely used by online retail Forex speculative traders. Developed by MetaQuotes Software, it provides tools and resources allowing traders to analyze price dynamics, place trades, and automate trading strategies using Expert Advisors (EAs).

## Why Use MT4 with Exness?

* **Industry Standard:** MT4 is perhaps the most well-known and widely supported Forex trading platform globally.
* **User-Friendly (for its time):** While older than MT5, its interface is familiar to millions of traders and relatively straightforward for basic operations.
* **Wide Availability of Tools:** A vast library of custom indicators, scripts, and Expert Advisors (EAs) has been developed for MT4's MQL4 programming language.
* **Stability:** MT4 is known for its reliability.
* **Exness Integration:** Exness provides dedicated MT4 servers and full support for the platform, ensuring seamless connectivity and execution.

## Step 1: Open an Exness Account (If You Haven't Already)

You need an Exness trading account (Real or Demo) before you can log into MT4.

1.  **Go to the Exness Website:** Visit the official Exness website.
2.  **Register or Log In:** Sign up for a new account or log in to your Personal Area.
3.  **Create a Trading Account:** Open a trading account (e.g., Standard, Pro). Make sure to specifically choose an account type that is compatible with the **MT4 platform**.

**(Refer to the "How to Trade Forex on Exness For Beginners" guide for detailed steps on Exness account opening and verification).**

## Step 2: Download and Install Exness MT4

To ensure the best connection to Exness servers, download MT4 directly from your Exness Personal Area or the Exness website.

1.  **Log in to your Exness Personal Area.**
2.  **Go to the "Trading Platforms" or "Downloads" section.**
3.  **Find "MetaTrader 4"** and select the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
4.  **Download the Installer.**
5.  **Run the Installer:** Follow the on-screen instructions to install MT4 on your computer or mobile device. Look for the Exness branding during installation, which confirms it's the version pre-configured for Exness servers.

## Step 3: Log In to Your Exness Account on MT4

Once installed, you need to connect the MT4 platform to your specific Exness trading account.

1.  **Open MetaTrader 4.**
2.  **Go to "File" > "Login to Trade Account".**
3.  **Enter Your Login (Account Number):** Input the trading account number you noted in Step 1.
4.  **Enter Your Password:** Input the trading password for that account.
5.  **Select Your Server:** This is crucial! From the dropdown menu, select the specific server name associated with your account (e.g., Exness-Trial for demo accounts, or a specific Exness-Real server number for real accounts). You can find this information in your Exness Personal Area under the account details.
6.  **Click "Login".** If your details are correct, you will be logged in, and you should hear a connection sound. Your account balance and details will appear in the "Terminal" window.

## Step 4: Navigate the MT4 Interface (Beginner Essentials)

The MT4 interface has several key windows:

* **Market Watch:** (Usually on the left, Ctrl+M to show/hide) Lists available trading instruments (symbols) with their current Bid (sell) and Ask (buy) prices.
* **Charts:** (The main central area) Displays price charts for selected instruments. Each chart shows the price movement over a specific timeframe.
* **Navigator:** (Usually on the left, Ctrl+N to show/hide) Contains your trading accounts, indicators, Expert Advisors (EAs), and scripts. You drag these onto charts from here.
* **Terminal:** (Usually at the bottom, Ctrl+T to show/hide) This is a vital window with several tabs:
    * **Trade:** Shows your open positions, pending orders, account balance, equity, margin, and floating profit/loss.
    * **Account History:** Shows your closed trades, deposits, and withdrawals.
    * Other tabs include News, Mailbox, Journal, etc.

## Step 5: Find Trading Instruments (Symbols)

Exness offers many instruments tradable on MT4. Here's how to access them:

1.  **Go to the Market Watch window.**
2.  Right-click anywhere in the Market Watch window.
3.  Select **"Symbols"**.
4.  A new window will open showing categories (Forex, Crypto, Metals, Indices, etc.). Navigate through these categories.
5.  Click on a symbol (e.g., EURUSD, XAUUSD) and click **"Show"**. This will add it to your main Market Watch list.
6.  Click "Close". The symbols you added are now in your Market Watch. Right-clicking in Market Watch and selecting "Show All" is also a quick way to see all available symbols.

## Step 6: Understand Charts and Market Data

Charts are where you analyze price movements.

1.  **Open a Chart:** Drag a symbol from the Market Watch window onto a chart area, or right-click a symbol and select "Chart Window".
2.  **Timeframes:** Use the toolbar (M1, M5, H1, D1, etc.) or the "Charts" menu > "Periodicity" to change the timeframe.
3.  **Chart Types:** Switch between Bar Chart, Candlesticks, or Line Chart using the toolbar.
4.  **Add Indicators:** Open the Navigator window, expand "Indicators", and drag an indicator (e.g., Moving Average, RSI) onto your chart. Configure its settings in the pop-up window.
5.  **Bid/Ask Lines:** You can add lines to the chart showing the current Bid and Ask prices (Right-click chart > Properties > Common > Show Ask line).

## Step 7: Place Your First Trade (on your Demo Account!)

It's time to practice placing a trade using your Exness Demo Account on MT4.

1.  **Open the Order Window:**
    * Click the **"New Order"** button on the toolbar (usually near the top left), or
    * Right-click the instrument in Market Watch and select "New Order", or
    * Press F9 on your keyboard.
2.  **Configure the Order:**
    * **Symbol:** Make sure the correct instrument is selected.
    * **Volume:** This is your position size, measured in lots. Tap or click here to enter the amount. **For beginners, especially on a Demo account, start with the smallest possible volume (e.g., 0.01 lots) to understand the risk.**
    * **Stop Loss (SL):** **CRUCIAL!** Enter the price level at which you want the trade to automatically close to limit your loss if the market moves against you. **Always set an SL.**
    * **Take Profit (TP):** Enter the price level at which you want the trade to automatically close to lock in profit if the market moves in your favor.
    * **Type:** Usually "Market Execution" for immediate buying or selling at the current price, or "Pending Order". For beginners, Market Execution is simplest.
    * **Deviation (for Market Execution):** Allows slight price variations. Default is often fine.
3.  **Choose Buy or Sell:**
    * Click the large **"Buy by Market"** button if you believe the price will rise.
    * Click the large **"Sell by Market"** button if you believe the price will fall.
4.  **Confirm:** The trade will be executed.

**Pending Orders:** If you choose "Pending Order" as the Type, you can set an order to be opened automatically when the price reaches a specific level in the future (Buy Limit, Sell Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Stop). You'll need to specify the entry price and type.

## Step 8: Monitor Your Open Trades

Your active trades and pending orders appear in the **"Trade" tab of the Terminal window**.

* See details like Order number, Time, Type (Buy/Sell), Volume, Symbol, Price (entry price), SL, TP, current Price, and Profit (floating P/L).
* The Profit/Loss will fluctuate based on market movements.

## Step 9: Modify or Close Your Trade

You can adjust your SL/TP or close a trade manually before it hits those levels.

1.  **Modify:** In the "Trade" tab of the Terminal, right-click on the open position or pending order. Select **"Modify or Delete Order"**. A window will pop up allowing you to change the SL and TP levels.
2.  **Close Manually:**
    * In the "Trade" tab of the Terminal, double-click the open position. A new window will appear.
    * Click the yellow **"Close #[Order Number] buy/sell [Volume] [Symbol] at [Current Price]"** button.
    * Alternatively, right-click the trade and select **"Close Order"**.

## Step 10: Withdraw Your Funds

Withdrawals are managed through your Exness Personal Area, not directly within the MT4 platform itself.

1.  **Log in to your Exness Personal Area** on the Exness website or through the Exness Trader mobile app.
2.  Go to the **"Withdrawal"** section.
3.  Choose your preferred withdrawal method (often must be the same method used for deposit).
4.  Enter the amount and follow the instructions.

## Important Tips for Trading on MT4 with Exness (Beginners)

* **MASTER THE DEMO ACCOUNT:** Spend significant time practicing *all* these steps on your Exness Demo account within MT4 until you are fully comfortable and consistently profitable in a simulated environment.
* **Learn the Interface:** Take time to explore all the menus and toolbars in MT4. Use online tutorials specific to MT4.
* **Understand Volume (Lot Size):** Know the value of 1 pip for your chosen volume and currency pair. Use a position size calculator if needed. Incorrect volume is a major reason for quick losses.
* **ALWAYS USE STOP LOSS:** This is essential for managing risk, especially when using leverage. Protect your capital.
* **Start Simple:** Don't clutter your charts with too many indicators initially. Focus on understanding price action and a few key tools.
* **Risk Management:** MT4 is a tool, but managing risk is *your* responsibility. Define how much you are willing to risk per trade and per day.
* **Be Aware of Exness Specifics:** Check Exness's website for specific details on account types compatible with MT4, leverage limits, spreads for different instruments, and trading hours, as these apply within MT4.
* **MT4 vs MT5:** Be aware that MT5 exists and has more features (more timeframes, indicators, asset classes, different programming language MQL5). Choose the platform that best suits your needs and what your account type is compatible with.
