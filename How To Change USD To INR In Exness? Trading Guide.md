# How To Handle USD and INR In Exness: Trading Guide

This guide explains how to manage both USD and INR within your Exness account, clarifying the common question about "changing" currency. It's important to understand that you generally cannot change the base currency of an *existing* trading account. Instead, Exness allows you to create accounts in different currencies and transfer funds between them.

**Important Note:** Trading financial markets involves risk. This guide focuses on currency management within Exness and does not provide financial advice.

## Introduction: Understanding Currency in Your Exness Account

Your Exness account actually operates on two levels regarding currency:

1.  **Your Personal Area Currency:** This is the main currency displayed in your Personal Area for overall balances, deposits, and withdrawals. You usually set this during initial registration.
2.  **Trading Account Base Currency:** Each individual trading account (MT4, MT5, Exness Trade) has its own base currency (e.g., USD, EUR, INR, etc.). This is set when you *create* that specific trading account. Your balance, P/L, and margin for that account are shown in this base currency.

You cannot change the base currency of a trading account after it's created. However, you can easily work with both USD and INR within your single Exness Personal Area.

The question "How to Change USD to INR in Exness?" usually refers to one of the following actions:

* Creating a new trading account that uses INR as its base currency.
* Transferring funds from an account with USD base currency to an account with INR base currency (or vice versa) within your Exness Personal Area.
* Depositing or withdrawing funds in one currency, which is then converted to the account's base currency.

Let's look at the correct ways to handle this.

## Option 1: Create a New Trading Account with INR Base Currency

This is the recommended method if you want to start trading or manage funds with INR as the primary currency for a specific account.

* You will create a brand new trading account (Real or Demo) and select INR as its base currency during the creation process.

**Step-by-Step (Quick Summary):**

1.  **Log In to Your Exness Personal Area.**
2.  **Go to the "My Accounts" Section.**
3.  **Click "Open New Account"** (+ New Account).
4.  Choose whether it's a **Real** or **Demo** account.
5.  Select the **Platform** (MT4, MT5, or Exness Trade).
6.  Choose the **Account Type** (Standard, Pro, etc.).
7.  Crucially, set the **Account Currency** to **INR (Indian Rupees)** from the dropdown list.
8.  Set Leverage, Nickname, and **Trading Password** for this new account.
9.  Click "Create Account".

You will now have a dedicated trading account where all values are displayed in INR.

**(For a more detailed guide on creating a new trading account with INR, please refer to the "How to Trade Exness in INR?" guide, specifically Step 1).**

## Option 2: Transfer Funds Between Accounts with Different Base Currencies (USD and INR)

You can easily move funds between any of your trading accounts within your Exness Personal Area, even if they have different base currencies. Exness performs the currency conversion automatically during the internal transfer.

**Step-by-Step for Internal Transfer (USD to INR, or vice versa):**

1.  **Log In to Your Exness Personal Area.**
2.  **Go to the "Internal Transfer" Section:** This is usually found in the "Funds" or "Wallet" section of your dashboard.
3.  **Select "Transfer between your accounts".**
4.  **Choose the "From Account":** Select the trading account where the funds are currently located (e.g., your USD account).
5.  **Choose the "To Account":** Select the trading account where you want to send the funds (e.g., your INR account).
6.  **Enter the Amount:** Enter the amount you wish to transfer from the "From Account". The amount is entered in the base currency of the "From Account".
7.  **View Conversion Rate:** Exness will typically show you the current exchange rate that will be used for the conversion and the estimated amount that will arrive in the "To Account" (in the "To Account's" base currency).
8.  **Confirm Transfer:** Review the details, including the amount and the conversion rate, and confirm the transfer.

The funds will be deducted from the source account and credited to the destination account after conversion by Exness.

## Option 3: Deposit/Withdraw in a Different Currency than Your Account

Exness also allows you to deposit funds in one currency and have them automatically converted to the base currency of your trading account, or withdraw from an account with conversion.

* **Depositing:** If you deposit INR into a USD account (or vice versa), Exness will convert the deposited amount using their current exchange rate and credit your account in its base currency.
* **Withdrawing:** If you withdraw INR from a USD account (or vice versa), Exness will convert the amount using their current exchange rate during the withdrawal process.

This conversion happens automatically. You usually select the deposit/withdrawal method in the currency you are using, and Exness handles the rest based on the target account's base currency.

## Understanding Currency Conversion Rates

When Exness performs currency conversions (for internal transfers, deposits, or withdrawals), they use their own internal exchange rates. These rates are typically competitive but might include a small markup compared to the interbank rate. The rate applied will be shown to you before you confirm the transfer or transaction.

## Conclusion

You cannot change the base currency of an existing Exness trading account (like changing a USD account directly into an INR account). However, you can easily manage both USD and INR:

* **Create a new trading account with INR as the base currency** if you want an account primarily denominated in Indian Rupees.
* **Use internal transfers** within your Personal Area to move funds between your existing USD and INR accounts, with Exness handling the automatic conversion.
* **Deposit or withdraw funds** in either USD or INR, and Exness will convert them as needed based on the account's base currency.

Choose the method that best suits your goal, whether it's setting up a dedicated INR trading environment or simply moving funds between your accounts.
